Created this repo to be able to test out various concepts in the E2E workflow.

Have now figured out how to do the following:
- write code locally in visual studio code
- pull latest version of repo from GitHub
- push updates to GitHub repo
- publish code to custom domain owned through GoDaddy
- install and use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
